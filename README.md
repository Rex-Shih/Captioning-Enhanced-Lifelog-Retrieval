# Visual Lifelog Retrieval through Captioning-Enhanced Interpretation (CIVIL)

This repository releases the **caption dataset** and supporting resources for our **IEEE BigData 2024** paper, **‚ÄúVisual Lifelog Retrieval through Captioning-Enhanced Interpretation (CIVIL)‚Äù**. The core idea is **captioning before retrieval**. We generate multiple caption types per image (and per short sequence), then retrieve with text‚Äìtext similarity.

### Sample Entry
Also see [sampleData.json](sampleData.json)  
```json
{
  "id": "u1_20180525_0208_i00",
  "Idefics2": "A person is in an elevator that has the number 7 on it.",
  "LLaVA-Next": "The image captures a moment of solitude and introspection in a modern, well-lit elevator. The person, dressed in a crisp white shirt, stands alone, their reflection mirrored in the elevator's polished surface. The elevator's interior is sleek and minimalist, with a blue carpet underfoot and a yellow accent wall adding a pop of color. The time on the elevator reads 07:08, suggesting it's early morning or late evening. The individual appears to be in a state of quiet contemplation, perhaps reflecting on the day ahead or the day just past. The elevator's motion is captured in the blurred background, adding a sense of movement and progress. The overall atmosphere is one of calm and introspection, a snapshot of a moment in time within the confines of an urban elevator. ",
  "Internlm-xcomposer2": "The image captures a moment at 07:08, where a person is standing in front of an elevator door. The reflection of the individual can be seen in the mirror-like surface of the door, creating a unique perspective.",
  "Video-LLaVA": "At 07:08, a person is seen holding a knife and cutting a piece of meat. The person is standing in front of a table with a plate of food, and there is a potted plant nearby. The person appears to be focused on their task, and the scene is well-lit, with natural light coming in from a window. The person's actions suggest that they are preparing a meal, and the presence of the potted plant adds a touch of greenery to the setting.",
  "Large-World-Model": "The video showcases a man in a suit entering a luxurious watch store, a woman walking through the store, and a man playing a piano. The man playing the piano is seen from different angles, and the camera pans around the store, capturing the various items on display.",
  "fine-grained": "Blurry reflection of a person in an elevator with visible door frame.",
  "coarse-grained": "Riding the elevator and pressing the floor button.",
  "Experience-summary": "Started the morning by taking the elevator, visiting the hotel lobby, interacting with staff, then enjoying a buffet breakfast."
